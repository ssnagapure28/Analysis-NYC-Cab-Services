# NYC-Cab-Services-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the shifting preferences for cab services over public transportation in New York City, exploring socio-economic factors, urban demographics, and other influences on commuter decisions.

## Objective
The main goal is to understand what drives the increasing preference for cabs in NYC and to develop a predictive model that helps cab drivers make more profitable decisions.

## Datasets
Description of all datasets used in the project:
- **NYC TLC Trip Records**: Detailed data on taxi trips including times, locations, distances, fares, etc.
- **NYC Taxi Zone Dataset**: Geometric and location data for taxi operational zones.
- **NYC Weather Data**: Comprehensive weather patterns recorded in Central Park.
- **NYPD Crime Statistics**: Crime data across NYC transit districts.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques and processes used to prepare the data.
- **Analysis**: Approaches taken to analyze the data, including comparative analysis and impact studies.
- **Modeling**: Details about the neural network model developed to predict taxi fares.
